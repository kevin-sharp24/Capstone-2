# Capstone-2

In this project, I will tackle the problem of character recognition in natural scenes - that is, images obtained through photographs of objects in the real world such as street signs, business signs, and other sources of text, rather than images of computer fonts or similarly normalized text. These “natural” images display a far greater degree of variability in text styles than computer fonts, so they pose a more significant challenge in the realm of computer vision; classical OCR methods do not perform nearly as well on natural images as they do on computer-generated text.
